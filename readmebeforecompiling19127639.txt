READ AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS TO EXECUTE 19127639's ASSIGNMENT:

PLEASE READ
A lot of people were having problems changing the make files/cmake files and what not so I haven't touched any of the files and any of the files in the directories for that reason.

My Assignment code is located in OpenGL->src->3.openGL_tutorial->sample_2->sample2.cpp and the other files.

Again, I haven't renamed/modified/deleted any of the other files, this folder is from the prac and I haven't changed the structure/directories
or any of the cmake/make stuff because so many people were running into issues when they tried to rename the files and what not.

In the assignment specification it doesn't say anything about names/directories/editing cmake/make files so I'm going to assume you will be ok with this.


Compile Instructions:
- Make sure the folder in the zip titled "OpenGL" is in your DESKTOP and is the only one in the desktop. Keep in mind if you're not using linux/if you compile anywhere other than
desktop it will not compile/you have to change all the makefile/cmake stuff. 
- If the file named "OpenGL" in the ZIP is in your desktop, open "OpenGL" and go into "build".
- Type "cmake .." 
- Type "make"

Execution Instructions:
- Make sure you've compiled the program.
- In "OpenGL" go to "Build" and then "bin" then "3.openGL_tutorial" and then just execute the program.
It's just the same as how you execute the prac.
